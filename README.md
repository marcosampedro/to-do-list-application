# to-do-list-application
A to do list application created with Node.js that saves the list items through a MongoDB Atlas database

## Usage
Open the project in an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code was used to construct this)

Install the npm dependencies from the package.json file

Run app.js to your local host server. nodemon was what I used to run this project. To install nodemon, input "npm install -g nodemon" in your terminal. Once installed, run "nodemon app.js" to the terminal

In order to access the project through your local host server, make sure your url is: **http://localhost:3000/todo**

Add and delete items as you wish to test the project out!
